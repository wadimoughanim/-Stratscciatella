This module is a backtesting infra i built to learn how to integrate properly c++ code into a python project

I want to do it as flexible as possible to be able to test different strategies and indicators on several kind of timeseries price data.

I make it fully flexiable, capable to handle very different kind of data as input

also multigranularity data, and multiasset data

-----
for me
$ python -m tests.test_generate_mock_data
rm -rf ./*
